#+TITLE: Next bigger number with the same digits

Create a function that takes a positive integer and returns the next bigger number that can be formed by rearranging its digits. For example:

#+begin_src
  12 ==> 21
 513 ==> 531
2017 ==> 2071

#+end_src
If the digits can't be rearranged to form a bigger number, return -1 (or nil in Swift, None in Rust):

#+begin_src
  9 ==> -1
111 ==> -1
531 ==> -1
#+end_src
